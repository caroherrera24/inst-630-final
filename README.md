# inst-630-final
For my INST 630 final project, I created a 3D visualization of meteorites landing over the Earth using the [meteorite landing API](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh/about_data).

After cleaning the data using Python to remove entries with missing information, I animated each meteorite landing with JavaScript, GSAP, and Three.js. You can watch each meteorite move through space and impact Earth, which is represented through a series of red rings. You can move the Earth to explore different regions. The year of the current meteorite landing animation is displayed above the globe.

Also, by hovering over the Earth and the landing sites, you can discover more information about each meteorite landing through a tooltip.
